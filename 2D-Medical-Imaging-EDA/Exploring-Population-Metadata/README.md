## Exploring Population Metadata

The important aspect of EDA is exploring your population.<br><br>
You'll be given a dataframe that describes a large dataset. Your goal is to perform EDA on the population in the dataset such that you can answer the following questions:<br>
- How are the different diseases distributed in my dataset in terms of frequency and co-occurrence with one another? (For the sake of time, just choose one of the diseases and assess its co-occurrence frequencies with all other diseases.)
- How is age distributed across my dataset? Is it distributed differently for different diseases?
- How is sex distributed across my dataset? Is it distributed differently for different diseases?
- For findings that have a Mass_size (i.e. not just a binary classification of disease presence) is there a relationship between size and age, sex, or presence of other diseases?
