#### Clinical Applications
- How x-rays are absorbed differently by different types of tissue.
- Look at two chest x-rays, one healthy and one diseased, as well as an asymmetrical mammography study.
- In each of these images you will be asked to identify areas of the image that contain specific types of organs or tissues (`e.g. lung, bone, tumor`) and then plot the intensity values for those regions of the image. 
- Notice how different the intensity values are, and how it is these intensity value differences that allow your eye to easily distinguish between different anatomical structures in the images.
